# Stark Bank Elixir SDK Beta

Welcome to the Stark Bank Elixir SDK! This tool is made for Elixir
developers who want to easily integrate with our API.
This SDK version is compatible with the Stark Bank API v2.

If you have no idea what Stark Bank is, check out our [website](https://www.StarkBank.com/)
and discover a world where receiving or making payments
is as easy as sending a text message to your client!

## Supported Elixir Versions

This library supports Elixir versions 1.9+.

## Stark Bank API documentation

Feel free to take a look at our [API docs](https://www.starkbank.com/docs/api).

## Versioning

This project adheres to the following versioning pattern:

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment:

- MAJOR version when the **API** version is incremented. This may include backwards incompatible changes;
- MINOR version when **breaking changes** are introduced OR **new functionalities** are added in a backwards compatible manner;
- PATCH version when backwards compatible bug **fixes** are implemented.

## Setup

### 1. Install our SDK

To install the package with mix, add this to your deps and run `mix deps.get`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:starkbank, "~> 0.5.1"}
  ]
end
```

### 2. Create your Private and Public Keys

We use ECDSA. That means you need to generate a secp256k1 private
key to sign your requests to our API, and register your public key
with us so we can validate those requests.

You can use one of following methods:

2.1. Check out the options in our [tutorial](https://starkbank.com/faq/how-to-create-ecdsa-keys).

2.2. Use our SDK:

```elixir
{private_key, public_key} = StarkBank.Key.create()

# or, to also save .pem files in a specific path
{private_key, public_key} = StarkBank.Key.create("file/keys/")
```

**Note**: When you are creating a new Project, it is recommended that you create the
keys inside the infrastructure that will use it, in order to avoid risky internet
transmissions of your **private-key**. Then you can export the **public-key** alone to the
computer where it will be used in the new Project creation.

### 3. Create a Project

You need a project for direct API integrations. To create one in Sandbox:

3.1. Log into [Starkbank Sandbox](https://sandbox.web.starkbank.com)

3.2. Go to Menu > Usuários (Users) > Projetos (Projects)

3.3. Create a Project: Give it a name and upload the public key you created in section 2.

3.4. After creating the Project, get its Project ID

3.5. Use the Project ID and private key to create the object below:

```elixir
# Get your private key from an environment variable or an encrypted database.
# This is only an example of a private key content. You should use your own key.
private_key_content = "
-----BEGIN EC PARAMETERS-----
BgUrgQQACg==
-----END EC PARAMETERS-----
-----BEGIN EC PRIVATE KEY-----
MHQCAQEEIMCwW74H6egQkTiz87WDvLNm7fK/cA+ctA2vg/bbHx3woAcGBSuBBAAK
oUQDQgAE0iaeEHEgr3oTbCfh8U2L+r7zoaeOX964xaAnND5jATGpD/tHec6Oe9U1
IF16ZoTVt1FzZ8WkYQ3XomRD4HS13A==
-----END EC PRIVATE KEY-----
"

user = StarkBank.project(
    id: "5671398416568321",
    environment: :sandbox,
    private_key: private_key_content
)
```

NOTE 1: Never hard-code your private key. Get it from an environment variable or an encrypted database.

NOTE 2: We support `'sandbox'` and `'production'` as environments.

NOTE 3: The project you created in `sandbox` does not exist in `production` and vice versa.


### 4. Setting up the user

There are two kinds of users that can access our API: **Project** and **Member**.

- `Member` is the one you use when you log into our webpage with your e-mail.
- `Project` is designed for integrations and is the one meant for our SDK.

There are two ways to inform the user to the SDK:
 
4.1 Passing the user as argument in all functions using the `user` keyword:

```elixir
balance = StarkBank.Balance.get!(user: user)
```

4.2 Set it as a default user in the `config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
import Config

config :starkbank,
  project: [
    environment: :sandbox,
    id: "9999999999999999",
    private_key: private_key_content
  ]
```

Just select the way of passing the project user that is more convenient to you.
On all following examples we will assume a default user has been set in the configs.


### 5. Setting up the error language

The error language can also be set in the `config/config.exs` file:

```elixir
import Config

config :starkbank,
  language: "en-US"
```

Language options are "en-US" for english and "pt-BR" for brazilian portuguese. English is default


## Testing in Sandbox

Your initial balance is zero. For many operations in Stark Bank, you'll need funds
in your account, which can be added to your balance by creating a Boleto.

In the Sandbox environment, 90% of the created Boletos will be automatically paid,
so there's nothing else you need to do to add funds to your account. Just create
a few and wait around a bit.

In Production, you (or one of your clients) will need to actually pay this Boleto
for the value to be credited to your account.


## Usage

Here are a few examples on how to use the SDK. If you have any doubts, use the built-in
`h()` function to get more info on the desired functionality
(for example: `StarkBank.Boleto |> h`)

**Note**: Almost all SDK functions also provide a bang (!) version. To simplify the examples, they will be used the most throughout this README.

### Get balance

To know how much money you have in your workspace, run:

```elixir
balance = StarkBank.Balance.get!()
IO.puts(balance.amount / 100)
```

### Create boletos

You can create boletos to charge customers or to receive money from accounts
you have in other banks.

```elixir
boletos = StarkBank.Boleto.create!(
  [
    %StarkBank.Boleto{
        amount: 23571,  # R$ 235,71
        name: "Buzz Aldrin",
        tax_id: "012.345.678-90",
        street_line_1: "Av. Paulista, 200",
        street_line_2: "10 andar",
        district: "Bela Vista",
        city: "São Paulo",
        state_code: "SP",
        zip_code: "01310-000",
        due: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(30),
        fine: 5,  # 5%
        interest: 2.5,  # 2.5% per month
    }
  ]
) |> IO.inspect
```

**Note**: Instead of using Boleto structs, you can also pass each boleto element in map format

### Get boleto

After its creation, information on a boleto may be retrieved by passing its id.
Its status indicates whether it's been paid.

```elixir
boleto = StarkBank.Boleto.get!("6750458353811456")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Get boleto PDF

After its creation, a boleto PDF may be retrieved by passing its id.

```elixir
pdf = StarkBank.Boleto.pdf!("6750458353811456", layout: "default")

file = File.open!("boleto.pdf", [:write])
IO.binwrite(file, pdf)
File.close(file)
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Delete boleto

You can also cancel a boleto by its id.
Note that this is not possible if it has been processed already.

```elixir
boleto = StarkBank.Boleto.delete!("5202697619767296")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Query boletos

You can get a stream of created boletos given some filters.

```elixir
boletos = StarkBank.Boleto.query!(
  after: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(-2),
  before: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(-1),
  limit: 10
) |> Enum.take(10) |> IO.inspect
```

### Query boleto logs

Logs are pretty important to understand the life cycle of a boleto.

```elixir
for log <- StarkBank.Boleto.Log.query!(boleto_ids: ["6750458353811456"]) do
  log |> IO.inspect
end
```

### Get a boleto log

You can get a single log by its id.

```elixir
log = StarkBank.Boleto.Log.get!("6288576484474880")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Create transfers

You can also create transfers in the SDK (TED/DOC).

```elixir
transfers = StarkBank.Transfer.create!(
  [
    %StarkBank.Transfer{
        amount: 100,
        bank_code: "01",
        branch_code: "0001",
        account_number: "10000-0",
        tax_id: "012.345.678-90",
        name: "Tony Stark",
        tags: ["iron", "suit"]
    },
    %StarkBank.Transfer{
        amount: 200,
        bank_code: "341",
        branch_code: "1234",
        account_number: "123456-7",
        tax_id: "012.345.678-90",
        name: "Jon Snow",
    }
]) |> IO.inspect
```

**Note**: Instead of using Transfer structs, you can also pass each transfer element in map format

### Query transfers

You can query multiple transfers according to filters.

```elixir
for transfer <- StarkBank.Transfer.query!(
  after: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(-2),
  before: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(-1),
  limit: 10
) do
  transfer |> IO.inspect
end
```

### Get transfer

To get a single transfer by its id, run:

```elixir
transfer = StarkBank.Transfer.get!("4882890932355072")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Get transfer PDF

A transfer PDF may also be retrieved by passing its id.
This operation is only valid for transfers with "processing" or "success" status.

```elixir
pdf = StarkBank.Transfer.pdf!("4882890932355072")

file = File.open!("transfer.pdf", [:write])
IO.binwrite(file, pdf)
File.close(file)
```

Be careful not to accidentally enforce any encoding on the raw pdf content,
as it may yield abnormal results in the final file, such as missing images
and strange characters.

### Query transfer logs

You can query transfer logs to better understand transfer life cycles.

```elixir
logs = StarkBank.Transfer.Log.query!(limit: 50)
  |> Enum.take(50)
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Get a transfer log

You can also get a specific log by its id.

```elixir
log = StarkBank.Transfer.Log.get!("6610264099127296")
  |> IO.inspect
```

        tax_id: "012.345.678-90",
        scheduled: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(10),
        description: "take my money",
        tags: ["take", "my", "money"],
    },
    %StarkBank.BoletoPayment{
        bar_code: "34191972300000289001090064694197307144464000",
        tax_id: "012.345.678-90",
        scheduled: Date.utc_today |> Date.add(40),
        description: "take my money one more time",
        tags: ["again"],
    },
  ]

transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.create!(
  [
    %StarkBank.Transaction{
        amount: 100,  # (R$ 1.00)
        receiver_id: "5768064935133184",
        description: "Transaction to dear provider",
        external_id: "12345",  # so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
        tags: ["provider"]
    },
    %StarkBank.Transaction{
        amount: 234,  # (R$ 2.34)
        receiver_id: "5768064935133184",
        description: "Transaction to the other provider",
        external_id: "12346",  # so we can block anything you send twice by mistake
        tags: ["provider"]
    }
  ]
) |> IO.inspect
```

**Note**: Instead of using Transaction structs, you can also pass each transaction element in map format

### Query transactions

To understand your balance changes (bank statement), you can query
transactions. Note that our system creates transactions for you when
you receive boleto payments, pay a bill or make transfers, for example.

```elixir
transactions = StarkBank.Transaction.query!(
  after: "2020-03-20",
  before: "2020-03-30"
) |> Enum.take(10) |> IO.inspect
```

### Get transaction

You can get a specific transaction by its id:

```elixir
transaction = StarkBank.Transaction.get!("6677396233125888")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Create webhook subscription

To create a webhook subscription and be notified whenever an event occurs, run:

```elixir
webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.create!(
  url: "https://webhook.site/dd784f26-1d6a-4ca6-81cb-fda0267761ec",
  subscriptions: ["transfer", "boleto", "boleto-payment", "utility-payment"]
) |> IO.inspect
```

### Query webhooks

To search for registered webhooks, run:

```elixir
for webhook <- StarkBank.Webhook.query!() do
  webhook |> IO.inspect
end
```

### Get webhook

You can get a specific webhook by its id.

```elixir
webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.get!("6178044066660352")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Delete webhook

You can also delete a specific webhook by its id.

```elixir
webhook = StarkBank.Webhook.delete!("6178044066660352")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Process webhook events

It's easy to process events that have arrived in your webhook. Remember to pass the
signature header so the SDK can make sure it's really StarkBank that has sent you
the event.

```elixir
response = listen()  # this is the function you made to get the events posted to your webhook

{event, cache_pid} = StarkBank.Event.parse!(
  content: response.content,
  signature: response.headers["Digital-Signature"]
) |> IO.inspect
```

To avoid making unnecessary requests to the API (/GET public-key), you can pass the `cache_pid` (returned on all requests)
on your next parse. The process referred by the PID `cache_pid` will store the latest Stark Bank public key
and automatically refresh it if an inconsistency is found between the content, signature and current public key.

**Note**: If you don't send the cache_pid to the parser, a new cache process will be generated.

```elixir
{event, _cache_pid} = StarkBank.Event.parse!(
  content: response.content,
  signature: response.headers["Digital-Signature"],
  cache_pid: cache_pid
) |> IO.inspect
```

If the data does not check out with the Stark Bank public-key, the function will automatically request the
key from the API and try to validate the signature once more. If it still does not check out, it will raise an error.

### Query webhook events

To search for webhooks events, run:

```elixir
events = StarkBank.Event.query!(
  after: "2020-03-20",
  is_delivered: false,
  limit: 10
) |> Enum.take(10) |> IO.inspect
```

### Get webhook event

You can get a specific webhook event by its id.

```elixir
event = StarkBank.Event.get!("4568139664719872")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Delete webhook event

You can also delete a specific webhook event by its id.

```elixir
event = StarkBank.Event.delete!("4568139664719872")
  |> IO.inspect
```

### Set webhook events as delivered

This can be used in case you've lost events.
With this function, you can manually set events retrieved from the API as
"delivered" to help future event queries with `is_delivered: false`.

```elixir
event = StarkBank.Event.update!("5764442407043072", is_delivered: true)
  |> IO.inspect
```

## Handling errors

The SDK may raise or return errors as the StarkBank.Error struct, which contains the "code" and "message" attributes.

If you use bang functions, the list of errors will be converted into a string and raised.
If you use normal functions, the list of error structs will be returned so you can better analyse them.
